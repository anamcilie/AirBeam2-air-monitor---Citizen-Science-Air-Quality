# AirBeam2-air-monitor---Citizen-Science-Air-Quality
 Data processing/analysis



This project describes how to make use of the Python programming language for air quality data processing, analysis, and visualization. 
An emphasis was laid on understanding the PM2.5 concentrations in Southside Williamsburg. 
As a part of raising awareness and disseminating knowledge, workshops and training were conducted to help students better understand air pollution levels 
in their community and learn how to use the Airbeam2 air quality monitors, to collect and process environmental data. 
As part of data acquisition, high school students gathered data at their schools, schoolyards, and playgrounds using the AirBeam2s. 
The Python scripts were written to help community-based organizations and high school students work with the data collected. 
The scripts made it easier to process the data (missing data, filtering noisy data, outlier analysis, data cleaning, etc.), to analyze the data 
(exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, time series-based analysis, trend, seasonality, regression analysis, etc.), 
and to visualize the data, communicating the results through visual tools and dashboards.
